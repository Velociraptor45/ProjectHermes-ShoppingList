# Project Hermes
Project Hermes is a personal project that attempts to create a save VPN communication option from anywhere in the world over a RaspberryPi cluster at home - where everything's running in Docker containers. Addtionally, smart home services, the development of a personal web-app for applications and many things more are planned!

If you need assistance reproducing my setup, feel free to open an issue or contact me.

## Network Communication
The connection between outside networks and the internal home network is working. To see how it's done, check issue [#8](/../../issues/8).
